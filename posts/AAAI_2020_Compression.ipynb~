The Hessian is calculated by matrix-free power of iteration method, avoiding the challenge of computing 2nd-order derivates.  Furthermore, it adopted structured quantization for finer control within layers.\n",

Quantizing both weights and activations, the method only lost 1\\% accuracy with 4-bit quantization, and restored accuracy by using distillation without labelled data.\n",
