        "# PocketFlow unofficial guide\n",
        "\n",
        "[PocketFlow](https://github.com/Tencent/PocketFlow/) is a model compression framework open-sourced by Tencent.  After a close look, I find it should be a fairly handy tool.  However, there are three caveats:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The [tutorial] is not very helpful if you want to build your own model;\n",
        "2. The repo is not actively maintained (sadly to see no support from Tencent);\n",
        "3. There are some problems with TF versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am trying to address the above problems, and in the article, I am trying to provide a userful guidance to compress your own model.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps to build a training/compression pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Clone the repo\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    git clone git@github.com:Tencent/PocketFlow.git\n",
        "    cd PocketFlow\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    From now on, the working directory is the repo folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Set up data input pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "   a. Create `path.conf`, a template is at `./path.conf.template`.  This file specifies the data path as `data_dir_local_<dataset> = ...`.  The name `<dataset>` is important, and will be used in below. \n",
        "\n",
        "   b. Create `Dataset` class for your data at `./datasets/<your dataset classe>.py`.  The name of the class and the file name are not important, you will get the file path as `FLAGS.data_dir_local` without the `<dataset>` name here.  Importantly, you need inherate the `AbstractDataset` and define the following functions and properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "      + `batch_size`\n",
        "      + `dataset_fn`: to create a tf Dataset object.\n",
        "      + `parse_fn`: to parse the dataset, and need to accept an argument `is_train` to differentiate training and testing pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Create your model\n",
        "\n",
        "   a. Create `<model>_at_<dataset>.py`.  It is important to use the same `<dataset>` as used in step 1.  Defining `ModelHelper` class is critical.  Basically using existing code as a template is a good start.  For the minimum, you need to define your model in `forward_fn` and replace the `dataset` class with yours defined above.\n",
        "\n",
        "   b. Create `<model>_at_<dataset>_run.py`.  It is important to use the same `<dataset>` as used in step 1.  In this file, basically you only need to replace the `ModelHelper` function from the file you defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Training and compression\n",
        "\n",
        "+ It is highly recommended to use `./script/run_local.sh nets/<model>_at_<dataset>_run.py` first to test your code and make sure PocketFlow can train it with full precision.\n",
        "+ The compression algorithms are under the name `learner`.  Find more information from the [official documentation](https://pocketflow.github.io/tutorial/).\n",
        "+ The optional arguments can be provided after the above running script.  Unfortunately the arguments are defined spreading the whole source codes with [FLAGS](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/flags).  Stay tuned, I will provide further guidance next time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fix version issues with Docker\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately the PocketFlow has compatability issues with Tensorflow newer versions.  To be on the safe side, use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  I will create a brief overview of the solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a `./Dockerfile` as below\n",
        "```\n",
        "FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:1.10-gpu-py3\n",
        "\n",
        "WORKDIR /tf\n",
        "ADD * /tf/   # this is the PocketFlow folder\n",
        "RUN pip install -r requirement.txt\n",
        "\n",
        "VOLUME /output  # to save outputs, change your code / flags accordingly\n",
        "VOLUME /data    # input path, don't put your data in the working folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "CMD ./script/run_local.sh nets/<model>_at_<dataset>_run.py <additional flags> ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Build the docker as `docker build -t <your image name> .`\n",
        "3. To run your docker with `bash`, run `docker run --gpus 0 --rm -it -v <your data folder>:/data -v <your output folder>:/output <your image name> bash`\n",
        "4. To run your training script (indicated by `CMD` in the `Dockerfile`, use `docker run --gpus 0 --rm -v <your data folder>:/data -v <your output folder>:/output <your image name>`."
